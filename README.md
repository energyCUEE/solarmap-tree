This paper presents the methodology of estimat- ing global horizontal irradiance (GHI) across Thailand and displaying as a Thailand solar irradiance map available at https://www.cusolarforecast.com/. Estimates of GHI can be further used to approximate potential generated solar power at locations where only install capacity is known. The method uses geographical information, clear-sky irradiance, and cloud amounts from Himawari-8 satellite images as inputs for tree- based models to approximate the clear-sky index under the presence of cloud. Currently, the random forest model is being implemented on the platform. After acquiring more historical data, our assessment shows that the LightGBM model achieves improved accuracy in most cloud conditions.
